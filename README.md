# Getting started with Multi-Objective Optimization

## Description
This notebook introduces you to the field of combinatorial optimization and its applications in HCI. The main goal is to give you an overview of the optimization landscape in terms of what classes of methods exist, what problems they can solve, and how they can be applied to HCI problems. To get some hands on experience it implements some specific methods.

## Installation
You can run this notebook on Colab or locally.

### For running on Colab (fast setup, runs slower):
Upload the intro-multi-objective-opt-colab.ipynb to colab and run the code.

### For running locally (slower setup, runs faster): 
If you want to run it locally we recommend creating a new environment using Anaconda, or a similar environment manager. You can install Anaconda or its lighter version Miniconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).

Then, use your terminal to create a new environment with the project dependencies and start the notebook:
> cd this_directory  
> conda env create -f environment.yml  
> conda activate opt  
> jupyter lab
